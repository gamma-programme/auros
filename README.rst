auROS: A UAV Apps Framework
===========================

auROS is a distribution of ROS tailored for use in unmanned aircraft (especially those supporting MAVLink).
It tries to make it easy to write applications that can update an aircraft's mission as it unfolds.
auROS is designed to run on a companion 'mission management' computer which is connected to the flight controller
but does not directly control the aircraft.

The GAMMA Programme
---------------
`The GAMMA programme <http://gammaprogramme.co.uk/>`_ was created to ask that, 
given that the intelligent vehicles and systems will exist – 
and remotely operated systems already do, how can they be used most effectively 
and how can the UK benefit most from that market?

If you can write a software app that makes life easier… 
Maybe it could identify a crime, patrol inside a nuclear reactor or tell a fighter jet where to go, 
then you could receive up to £150k per project to develop new concepts for intelligent software 
through the Growing Autonomous Mission Management Applications programme & receive assistance 
from academia and industry to take the product to market.

This work is being carried out as part of the GAMMA Programme by various partners (currently led by the 
University of Manchester) but we invite contributions from anyone who finds this useful!

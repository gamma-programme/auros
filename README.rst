auROS: A UAV Apps Framework
===========================

auROS is a distribution of ROS tailored for use in unmanned aircraft (especially those supporting MAVLink).
It tries to make it easy to write applications that can update an aircraft's mission as it unfolds.
auROS is designed to run on a companion 'mission management' computer which is connected to the flight controller
but does not directly control the aircraft.
